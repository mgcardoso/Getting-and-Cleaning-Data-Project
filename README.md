# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
The script run_analysis.R is based on this steps:
1-Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.
2-Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
3-Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
4-Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
5-Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
6-From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

#Process
1-Set the this folder (C:/Users/miria/Desktop/Coursera/UCI HAR Dataset) as my working directory.
2-Read the txt files
3-Proceed with each one step (beyond) with variables and functions explained in code book.
